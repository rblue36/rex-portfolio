## Mobile app development business

My first endevour into the digital space was a small app development business that I started when I was 13. My first app, "KSI Sounds", in partnership with YouTuber KSI, was bought over 130,000 times. It was the #1 paid entertainment app in the UK as well as the #3 overall. "W2S Rageboard" also received over 30,000 paid downloads and reached the top spot on the entertainment chart. My next project was venturing into the free app market with "U Want Sum-Board", which was downloaded over 250,000 times. I developed these apps for both iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java).
