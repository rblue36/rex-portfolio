## A swift app for sneaker collectors

Crep Collect is an app that primarily allows sneaker collectors to document, track and share their sneaker collection. It also facilitates the creation of a wanted list of sneakers that the user would like to purchase in the future. In addition, there is a ‘Releases’ section to keep up to date with upcoming releases and allow them to be added to the user’s collection or wanted list.

Crep Collect was designed and developed solely by me, as part of a third year module at university, achieving a first.

### UX and UI Design

Fully fledged UX designs were carried out with Axure. The UI for the app was designed with Sketch. Full design documentation was completed before development of the app began, containing all the UX and UI designs, have a look [here](/assets/work/crep-collect/Crep-Collect-Design-Documentation.pdf).

### App Development

The app was built with Swift UI. Firebase was used for the backend of the app. Check out the app in action in the video at the bottom of the page.
