## Helping football fans get tickets for the Euros

I created a python script that monitored the Uefa Euro 2020 ticketing site and tweeted when tickets became available. The account reached over 8,000 followers on twitter and was able to help hundreds of fans (and me!) get tickets to games that they will never forget. The account can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/LiveEurosTicks).
