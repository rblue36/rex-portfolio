## A basic web app to predict destinations that are likely to require a quarantine on return from holiday.

In the summer of 2020, it was tough to go on holiday due to COVID-19 restrictions. Locations were constantly removed the UK's travel corridor, if the country met the threshold of 20 cases per 100,000 people in the last 7 days, meaning that holidaymakers would have to isolate for 2 weeks on return to the UK.

With this data not easily available, my tool allowed the user to pick or search a country and subsequently data would be fetched for the last 7 days covid cases and the countries total population. The total amount of cases in the last 7 days is added together and divided by the population to calculate the number of cases per 100,000 people. If this is above 20, the user is given a message that this country will be removed from the travel corridor shortly, if it is not already. Therefore, the tool could be used to check on a potential holiday destination to assess the risk of it being removed from the UK's travel corridor.

The tool is still available [here](https://quarantine-tracker.herokuapp.com/), or watch the video below to see it in action. The source code is available here.
