## A react native sneaker marketplace app

WTB (Want to Buy) provides a platform that can successfully improve the efficiency of the buying and selling process for professional users who currently use social media apps to conduct C2C commerce, using the personal shopper sneaker market as an example of this. The app utilises React Native and Firebase to create an app which easily enables sneaker buyers to post wanted listings and allows sneaker sellers to be notified when a buyer wants a sneaker that they have. Buyers and sellers are connected with the match system.

WTB was my final year project at university, that I completed on my own. It received a high first classification.

### UX Design

Fully fledged UX designs were carried out with Axure for every screen in the app. View all the designs [here](/assets/work/wtb/WTB_UX.pdf).

### UI Design

High fidelity user interface designs were designed with Sketch app. View a selection of the screens below or see all [here](/assets/work/wtb/WTB_UI.png).

### App Development

The app was built with React Native and Expo. Firebase JS SDK was used for the backend of the app. View the final app in action in the video at the bottom of the page.

### User Research and Testing

Prior to the development of the app, interviews were conducted with potential users of the app to identify desired features and to develop an idea of an ideal user experience. In addition, following the first complete build of the app, user testing was undergone to pick up bugs as well as test the usability of the app.
