## A react native sneaker marketplace app

WTB provides a platform that can successfully improve the efficiency of the buying and selling process for professional users who currently use social media apps to conduct C2C commerce, using the personal shopper sneaker market as an example of this. The app utilises React Native and Firebase to create an app which easily enables sneaker buyers to post wanted listings and allows sneaker sellers to be notified when a buyer wants a sneaker that they have. Buyers and sellers are connected with the match system.
