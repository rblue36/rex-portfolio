## A prototype for a bitcoin themed mobile game, that highlights the issue of carbon emissions from cryptocurrencies.

A three stage process was undergone to complete this project. Fully fledged UX designs were carried out with Axure, followed by UI designs with sketch. Finally the app was prototyped using Invision. Check out the project report [here](/assets/work/bitcoin-mine/report.pdf) for more details and project visuals. See the prototype in action below.

Bitcoin Mine was a final year module project that I created on my own, receiving a first class classification.
