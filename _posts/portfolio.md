## Portfolio web app

I built my portfolio using Next.js and React. Markdown is used to format my work articles. Next.js is fetches the markdown files at build and displays them on the site.

## Open Source Code

The code for my portfolio is available publically on github. [Check it out here](https://github.com/rblue36/rex-portfolio).
